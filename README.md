## My process

### :wrench: Built with

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - JS server env
- [Discord.js](https://reactjs.org/) - JS Discord library
- [Tenor](https://tenor.com/gifapi) - Gif API 
- [DadJokes.io](https://dadjokes.io/) - DadJokes API
- [Vultr](https://vultr.com/) - VPS Host 

### :bulb: What I learned

This project is still in development. I've learned a bunch :D 

### :mountain_bicyclist: Continued development

The bot is currently in development, so it's not currently online, but will be soon using Vultr VPS.

Development wise, the discord.js message event is not the best way of handling requests, which is why at some point this application should be refactored using [Discord Slash Commands](https://discordjs.guide/creating-your-bot/slash-commands.html) instead.

In the future, I'd love to implement my own counter stats and serve them with pretty discord embeds, to make the whole build/ counter decision a lot quicker and the discord command more useful.

- [DiscordJS Guide](https://discordjs.guide/#before-you-begin) - Good guide on how to setup more modern bots with slash commands.
