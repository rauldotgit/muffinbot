## My process

### :wrench: Built with

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - JS server env
- [Discord.js](https://reactjs.org/) - JS Discord library
- [Tenor](https://reactjs.org/) - gif API 
- [Vultr](https://vultr.com/) - VPS Host 

### :bulb: What I learned


### :mountain_bicyclist: Continued development

Using the message event is not the best way of handling requests, which is why at some point this application should be refactored using [Discord Slash Commands](https://discordjs.guide/creating-your-bot/slash-commands.html) instead. But for the current functionality, this is more than enough.

### :cake: Useful resources

- [DiscordJS Guide](https://www.example.com) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
